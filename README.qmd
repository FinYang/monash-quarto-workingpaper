# Monash Working Paper Format Template

This is a Quarto template that assists you in creating a working paper for the Department of Econometrics & Business Statistics, Monash University.

## Creating a new working paper

You can use this as a template to create a working paper.
To do this, use the following command:

```bash
quarto use template quarto-monash/-workingpaper
```

This will install the extension and create an example qmd file that you can use as a starting place for your working paper.

## Installation for existing document

You may also use this format with an existing Quarto project or document.
From the quarto project or document directory, run the following command to install this format:

```bash
